## Inspiration for the Project

This is our final project for our Predictive Analytics Class in the MSBA project at the Carlson School of Management. 

## Project Goals

In this project, based on Woogle.io datasets we are tasked with finding the rating of human players before a game is played. The dataset includes 72773 games played by three bots on Woogles.io BetterBot (beginner), STEEBot (intermediate), and HastyBot (advanced). The games are between the bots and human users. We will be using metadata about the games and specific information about the turns in each game to predict the rating of the human opponents. The rating provided from our model will be evaluated by RMSE.  

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Keras, RandomForest, Lightgbm, XGboost
